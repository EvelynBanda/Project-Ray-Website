In this project I will be building an online store called 'Ray'. It is a womens clothing store. 
The website will have a website and a mobile design spec.
The website functionality will allow users to: search for items, create a profile, login, signout, add items to their cart and make purchases amongst others. 
The administrators will be able to create profiles, login as admin, be granted access to editing the website for example, uploading clothing item images.
Technologies used in building the website include: HTML/CSS, JavaScrips, ejs, NodeJS/ExpressJS, MongoDB,...
The project uses dependencies such as bcryptjs to secure user passwords and devDependencies such as nodemon to keep the local server updated automatically during the building process.
